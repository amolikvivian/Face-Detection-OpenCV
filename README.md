# Face-Detection-OpenCV
Face Detection using OpenCV in Python using different methods and models.

# Haar Cascade
The first method utilizes the pretrained Haar Cascade Classifier - frontalface_default to detect faces.
Added a small module to detect eyes from given frame in real time using - haarcascade_eye.

Primitive ways to detect faces and eyes, simple to understand and help in starting off with Computer Vision projects.
